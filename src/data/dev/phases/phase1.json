    "description": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that controls how HTML elements look on screen. While HTML provides structure and content, CSS handles the visual presentation — colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and animations. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying style rules to them. A CSS rule has two parts: a selector (which elements to style) and a declaration block (what styles to apply). Selectors range from simple (element, class, ID) to complex (descendant, child, sibling, pseudo-class, pseudo-element, attribute selectors). Understanding specificity — the system CSS uses to determine which styles win when multiple rules target the same element — is critical. The specificity hierarchy goes: inline styles (1000) > ID selectors (100) > class/attribute/pseudo-class selectors (10) > element/pseudo-element selectors (1). The cascade means styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden by more specific rules. CSS can be added three ways: inline (style attribute), internal (<style> tag in <head>), or external (separate .css file linked with <link>). External stylesheets are the industry standard because they separate concerns and allow one file to style multiple pages. Mastering selectors is the gateway to everything else in CSS — you can't style what you can't select.",
    "whyItMatters": "CSS is one of the three core web technologies alongside HTML and JavaScript. Every website you've ever visited uses CSS. Understanding selectors and specificity prevents the #1 frustration beginners face: 'why isn't my style applying?' Knowing which selector to use makes your CSS efficient, maintainable, and performant.",
    "eli5": "If HTML is the skeleton of a web page, CSS is the skin, clothes, and makeup! It decides what color things are, how big they are, where they sit on the page, and what happens when you hover over them. A CSS selector is like pointing at something and saying 'YOU — be red!' You can point at all paragraphs (<p>), or just the ones with a special class name (.special), or one specific element (#unique).",

    "description": "Typography and color are the most impactful visual design tools in CSS. The right font and color palette can make a website feel professional, playful, trustworthy, or modern. CSS supports multiple color formats: named colors (red, blue), hexadecimal (#FF5733), RGB (rgb(255,87,51)), RGBA with transparency (rgba(255,87,51,0.5)), HSL (hsl(14,100%,60%)), and modern OKLCH for perceptually uniform colors. For typography, the font-family property sets the typeface — always provide a fallback stack (e.g., 'Inter', sans-serif). Google Fonts offers 1000+ free web fonts that you can load via a <link> tag or @import rule. Font-size uses various units: px (fixed), em (relative to parent), rem (relative to root — recommended), vw/vh (relative to viewport). The font-weight property controls thickness (100-900 or keywords like bold). Line-height controls vertical spacing between lines — 1.5 to 1.7 is ideal for body text readability. Text-align controls horizontal alignment, text-transform handles capitalization (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize), letter-spacing adjusts character spacing, and text-decoration handles underlines/overlines. The color property sets text color, while background-color sets the background. Modern CSS also supports gradients (linear-gradient, radial-gradient) for beautiful background effects.",

    "phase": 1,
    "difficulty": "beginner",
    "estimatedHours": 3,
    "description": "Every single HTML element on a web page is rendered as a rectangular box. The CSS Box Model defines the space an element occupies, consisting of four layers from inside out: content (the actual text/image), padding (space between content and border), border (the visible edge), and margin (space between this element and neighboring elements). Understanding the box model is arguably the single most important CSS concept. Content is the inner area where text and images appear. Padding creates breathing room inside the element — it's part of the element's background. Border sits at the edge — you can control its width, style (solid, dashed, dotted), color, and radius (for rounded corners). Margin creates space outside the element — it's always transparent. A critical gotcha is box-sizing: by default (content-box), width and height only set the content area — padding and border are ADDED on top. This means a 300px-wide div with 20px padding and 2px border is actually 344px wide! Setting box-sizing: border-box includes padding and border in the width/height calculation, making layouts much more predictable. This is why nearly every modern CSS reset starts with * { box-sizing: border-box; }. Another important concept is margin collapsing: when two vertical margins touch, they merge into one (the larger one wins), not stack. Understanding this prevents unexpected spacing issues.",
    "whyItMatters": "The box model controls ALL spacing and sizing in CSS. 90% of 'my layout is broken' bugs come from not understanding the box model. box-sizing: border-box is used in every professional project. Margin collapse causes confusion for years if not understood early. This is tested in virtually every frontend interview.",
    "eli5": "Imagine your content is a gift inside a box. The padding is the bubble wrap around the gift (inside the box). The border is the cardboard box itself. The margin is the space between this box and other boxes on the shelf. If you measure how big the package is, you need to count the gift + bubble wrap + cardboard. That's the box model! The 'border-box' trick is like saying 'this box must be 30cm, no matter how much bubble wrap I use.'",

    "description": "The display and position properties are two of the most powerful and initially confusing CSS concepts. The display property controls how an element behaves in the flow of the page. Block elements (<div>, <h1>, <p>) take up the full width and stack vertically. Inline elements (<span>, <a>, <strong>) flow horizontally within text and only take up as much width as their content. Inline-block combines both: flows inline but accepts width/height like a block. display: none completely removes an element from the layout (unlike visibility: hidden which hides it but keeps the space). The position property controls WHERE an element sits relative to its normal position. Static is the default — elements flow normally. Relative moves the element from its normal position using top/right/bottom/left offsets but preserves its original space in the layout. Absolute removes the element from normal flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static). Fixed positions relative to the viewport — the element stays in place when you scroll (great for sticky headers). Sticky is a hybrid: acts normal until you scroll past a threshold, then sticks in place. Understanding z-index (which element appears on top when they overlap) requires understanding stacking contexts — z-index only works on positioned elements.",
    "whyItMatters": "Display and positioning control the fundamental behavior of every element on the page. Understanding the difference between block/inline is essential for layout.

    "eli5": "Imagine blocks are like paragraphs in a book — each starts on a new line and takes up the whole width. Inline elements are like words in a sentence — they sit next to each other.

Flexbox works on a parent-child relationship: you set display: flex on a container (the flex parent), and its direct children become flex items that you can arrange along one axis. The main axis is the primary direction (row = horizontal, column = vertical), and the cross axis is perpendicular. justify-content controls alignment along the main axis (center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly). align-items controls alignment along the cross axis (center, stretch, flex-start, flex-end). flex-wrap allows items to wrap to new lines when they don't fit. The flex shorthand on child items controls how they grow (flex-grow), shrink (flex-shrink), and their base size (flex-basis). gap creates consistent spacing between items without margin hacks. Common patterns solved by Flexbox: centering anything (both axes), navigation bars, card grids, footer at bottom of page, equal-height columns, and responsive layouts. Learning Flexbox changes how you think about CSS layout — it's the foundational layout tool every developer uses daily.",
    "whyItMatters": "Flexbox is used in virtually every modern website and framework. React, Vue, and Angular components all use Flexbox internally. It's the #1 CSS skill tested in frontend interviews. Before Flexbox, even simple vertical centering required hacks. Flexbox makes responsive layouts natural and intuitive.",
    "eli5": "Imagine you have a shelf (the flex container) and you're arranging books (flex items) on it. Flexbox lets you say: 'put the books in a row, center them on the shelf, and space them evenly.' You can also say 'if there are too many books, wrap them to the next shelf.' Without Flexbox, you'd have to measure and calculate each book's position manually. With Flexbox, you just describe what you want and the browser figures out the math!",

    "description": "CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system designed for creating complex page layouts. While Flexbox handles one axis at a time (either rows OR columns), Grid handles both simultaneously — making it perfect for overall page layouts, dashboards, galleries, and complex component arrangements. You create a grid by setting display: grid on a container and defining columns with grid-template-columns and rows with grid-template-rows. The fr unit (fraction) is Grid's superpower — it distributes available space proportionally. grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr creates three columns where the middle one is twice as wide as the sides. The repeat() function avoids repetition: repeat(3, 1fr) creates three equal columns. auto-fill and auto-fit with minmax() create responsive grids without media queries — repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)) creates as many 250px+ columns as fit, automatically adjusting the count based on viewport width. Grid areas let you name regions of your grid and assign elements to them — grid-template-areas: 'header header' 'sidebar main' 'footer footer'. gap controls spacing between grid cells. Grid items can span multiple rows/columns using grid-column: span 2 or explicit lines like grid-column: 1 / 3. While Flexbox vs Grid isn't either/or (they're complementary), a rule of thumb is: use Flexbox for component-level layout (navbars, cards) and Grid for page-level layout (overall structure, galleries).",
    "whyItMatters": "CSS Grid fundamentally changed web layout — tasks that required complex frameworks (Bootstrap grids, float-based grids) now take a few lines of CSS. Dashboard layouts, image galleries, magazine-style designs, and responsive page structures all use Grid. Together with Flexbox, it forms the complete modern CSS layout toolkit.",
    "eli5": "CSS Grid is like graph paper. You draw lines to create rows and columns, and then place your content into the boxes. You can say 'this picture takes up 2 boxes wide' or 'this sidebar is 1 column and the main content is 3 columns.' It's like playing Tetris — you have a grid and you place your blocks where you want them. The really cool part? You can tell the grid 'make as many columns as fit' and it automatically adjusts as the screen gets bigger or smaller!",

    "description": "Responsive Web Design (RWD) ensures your website looks great and functions well on all screen sizes — from tiny phone screens to ultra-wide desktop monitors. Over 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices, so building responsive layouts is not optional. The foundation is the viewport meta tag: <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'> — without it, mobile browsers zoom out to show the desktop version of your site in a tiny, unreadable format. Media queries are the CSS feature that enables responsive design. They let you apply different styles based on conditions like screen width: @media (min-width: 768px) { ... } applies styles only when the viewport is 768px or wider. Common breakpoints are: 640px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (laptop), 1280px (desktop). The 'mobile-first' approach is the industry standard: write base styles for mobile, then add complexity for larger screens using min-width queries. Modern CSS features reduce the need for media queries: Flexbox's flex-wrap, Grid's auto-fit with minmax(), clamp() for fluid typography (font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem)), and container queries for component-level responsiveness. Responsive images use srcset and different formats. Testing responsiveness is done via browser DevTools device emulation, which lets you simulate different screen sizes and even devices.",
    "whyItMatters": "Google uses mobile-first indexing — if your site isn't mobile-friendly, it ranks lower in search results. Over 60% of users will leave a site that doesn't work well on their phone. Responsive design is a non-negotiable requirement in every frontend job description and is heavily tested in interviews and portfolio reviews.",
    "eli5": "You know how water takes the shape of whatever container you pour it into? Responsive design makes your website work the same way — it reshapes itself to fit whatever screen it's viewed on. On a phone, a menu might become a hamburger button. On a big screen, three cards sit side by side. On a tablet, maybe two cards fit. You use 'media queries' to give the browser different instructions for different screen sizes: 'IF the screen is small, stack things vertically. IF the screen is big, put them side by side.'",

    "description": "Animations bring websites to life — they guide user attention, provide feedback (a button darkening on click), indicate state changes (loading spinners), and create delightful micro-interactions. CSS offers three animation tools: transforms, transitions, and keyframe animations. Transforms change an element's shape or position without affecting layout flow: translate() moves it, rotate() spins it, scale() resizes it, and skew() slants it. They're GPU-accelerated, making them ideal for smooth animations. Transitions create smooth changes between CSS states — when a property changes (like on :hover), instead of an instant jump, the browser smoothly interpolates between the old and new values over a duration you specify. The transition shorthand combines property, duration, timing function (ease, ease-in-out, linear, cubic-bezier), and delay. Keyframe animations (@keyframes) define multi-step sequences — you can create complex animations with any number of steps from 0% to 100%. The animation shorthand controls duration, timing, delay, iteration count (infinite for loops), direction (alternate for back-and-forth), and fill mode (forwards to keep the end state). Performance tip: only animate transform and opacity — they're handled by the GPU and don't trigger layout recalculation. Animating width, height, margin, or top triggers expensive 'reflow' that can make animations janky.",
    "whyItMatters": "Micro-animations differentiate a polished, professional website from a static one. Hover effects on buttons, smooth page transitions, loading animations, and scroll-triggered reveals all use these CSS properties. Framework libraries like Framer Motion and GSAP are built on these fundamental concepts. Understanding GPU-accelerated properties is essential for smooth 60fps animations.",
    "eli5": "Transitions are like magic eye drops — instead of a light switching from off to on instantly, it fades in smoothly. Transforms let you move, spin, grow, and shrink things.

    "description": "Modern CSS has evolved dramatically in recent years, gaining powerful features that previously required preprocessors like Sass or JavaScript. CSS Custom Properties (variables) let you define reusable values with --property-name syntax and access them with var(). Unlike preprocessor variables, CSS variables are live — they cascade, can be overridden per component, and even manipulated with JavaScript. This makes them perfect for design systems and theming (dark mode). Define variables on :root for global scope, or on specific selectors for component scope. The calc() function performs math in CSS: width: calc(100% - 250px) creates a fluid width minus a fixed sidebar. clamp() combines min(), preferred, and max() into one: font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem) creates fluid typography that never gets too small or too large. CSS nesting (finally native!) lets you write selector hierarchies like .card { .title { ... } } instead of flat selectors. The :has() pseudo-class is the 'parent selector' CSS lacked for 20 years — .card:has(img) targets cards that contain an image. The :is() and :where() pseudo-classes simplify complex selectors. aspect-ratio controls element proportions. These modern features are supported in all major browsers and form the foundation of professional CSS architecture.",
    "whyItMatters": "CSS variables eliminate magic numbers and make themes/design systems trivially easy to implement. Dark mode with CSS variables is industry standard. calc() and clamp() replace media queries for many responsive patterns. These modern features show that CSS is a powerful, evolving language — not just 'the thing you learn before JavaScript.'",
    "eli5": "CSS variables are like labels on paint cans. Instead of writing 'this exact shade of blue #6366f1' fifty times, you label a paint can '--brand-color' and just say 'use the paint from the brand-color can.' If you want to change your brand color, you change ONE paint can and everything updates automatically! That's way easier than finding and changing fifty different places.",
