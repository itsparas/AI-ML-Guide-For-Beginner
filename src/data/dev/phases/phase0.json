    "description": "Before writing a single line of code, it's essential to understand how the internet and world wide web actually work. When you type a URL like 'google.com' into your browser and press Enter, a fascinating chain of events unfolds in milliseconds. Your browser first contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server — think of it as the internet's phone book — to translate the human-readable domain name into a numerical IP address like 142.250.190.14. Your browser then sends an HTTP request to that server, asking for the webpage. The server processes this request and sends back an HTTP response containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Your browser then parses these files and renders the visual page you see. This is the client-server model: your browser is the 'client' that requests data, and the web server is the 'server' that responds with data. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the language they speak. HTTPS adds encryption via SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring your data (passwords, credit cards) can't be intercepted. Understanding this flow is foundational — every single concept you learn in web development (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript interactivity, APIs, hosting) connects back to this request-response cycle. Professional developers debug network issues, optimize load times, and architect systems based on these fundamentals daily.",
    "whyItMatters": "Every web technology you'll learn is built on top of this client-server architecture. Understanding how browsers fetch and render pages helps you debug issues, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about how to structure your code. Interviewers frequently ask about HTTP, DNS, and the request-response cycle.",
    "eli5": "Imagine you're ordering a pizza. You (the browser) call the pizza shop (the server) and ask for a pepperoni pizza (the web page). The pizza shop makes your pizza and delivers it to your door. The phone number you dial is like a URL, the phone company that connects your call is like DNS, and the pizza delivery is like the HTTP response bringing the website to your screen. HTTPS is like ordering through a secret code so no one can steal your pizza order!",

    "description": "Every web page you've ever visited is built on HTML — HyperText Markup Language. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, like the skeleton of a building. An HTML document follows a strict structure: it starts with a DOCTYPE declaration that tells the browser 'this is an HTML5 document.' Then comes the <html> root element that wraps everything. Inside <html>, there are two main sections: <head> (metadata that's invisible to users — page title, character encoding, CSS links, meta descriptions for SEO) and <body> (everything visible on the page — text, images, buttons, forms). HTML uses 'tags' — keywords wrapped in angle brackets like <h1>, <p>, <div>. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag <p> and a closing tag </p>, with content in between. Some tags are self-closing like <img /> and <br />. Tags can have 'attributes' that provide additional information, like <a href='https://example.com'> where 'href' is an attribute specifying the link destination. Understanding this structure is absolutely fundamental — every framework (React, Vue, Angular) ultimately generates HTML. Even the most complex web applications are, at their core, HTML documents enhanced with CSS and JavaScript. Proper HTML structure also affects SEO, accessibility, and how search engines index your content.",

    "description": "Text is the most fundamental type of content on the web. HTML provides a rich set of elements specifically designed for different types of text content. Headings (<h1> through <h6>) create a hierarchy — <h1> is the main page title, <h2> for major sections, <h3> for subsections, and so on. This hierarchy isn't just visual — search engines and screen readers use it to understand your page structure. Paragraphs (<p>) are the workhorse of text content. The <strong> and <em> tags add semantic emphasis (not just bold/italic — they convey meaning to assistive technology). Lists come in three flavors: ordered (<ol>) for numbered sequences, unordered (<ul>) for bullet points, and description lists (<dl>) for term-definition pairs. The <blockquote> element marks quoted content, while <code> and <pre> handle code snippets. Line breaks (<br>) and horizontal rules (<hr>) provide structural breaks. Understanding when to use which element is critical for semantic HTML — it's not about how text looks (that's CSS's job), it's about what the text means. A common beginner mistake is using <br><br> for spacing instead of proper paragraph tags, or using headings just to make text big rather than to create meaningful document structure.",
    "whyItMatters": "Proper text markup directly impacts SEO — search engines weight <h1> content heavily for page relevance. Screen readers navigate pages by heading hierarchy, so incorrect heading levels make your site inaccessible. Semantic text elements ensure your content works everywhere: browsers, search engines, screen readers, RSS feeds, and AI scrapers.",
    "eli5": "When you write a school essay, you have a title at the top (that's <h1>), chapter names (<h2>), regular paragraphs (<p>), and maybe a list of supplies (<ul> with <li> items).

Links can point to other websites (absolute URLs), other pages on your site (relative paths), sections within the same page (fragment identifiers using #), email addresses (mailto:), and phone numbers (tel:). The 'target' attribute controls where the link opens — '_blank' for a new tab, '_self' for the same tab. Images are the second most common content type, added via the self-closing <img> tag. The 'src' attribute specifies the image file, and the 'alt' attribute provides text description for accessibility (screen readers) and SEO. Modern HTML5 introduced native <video> and <audio> elements, replacing the need for Flash. The <video> tag supports multiple source formats for browser compatibility, along with controls, autoplay, muted, and loop attributes. The <picture> element enables responsive images — serving different image sizes based on screen width. The <iframe> element embeds external content like YouTube videos, Google Maps, or other web pages.

The <form> element wraps all form controls and defines where the data gets submitted (action attribute) and how (method: GET or POST). HTML5 introduced a powerful suite of input types beyond basic text: email (with built-in validation), password (masked dots), number (spin buttons), date (calendar picker), range (slider), color (color picker), file (upload), and more. Each input should have a <label> element linked via matching 'for' and 'id' attributes — this is critical for accessibility (screen readers announce the label when the input is focused). The <select> element creates dropdowns, <textarea> handles multi-line text, and <fieldset> with <legend> groups related inputs. HTML5 form validation attributes (required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, min, max) let you validate user input without any JavaScript — the browser handles error messages and prevents submission of invalid forms. Understanding form data flow is essential: when a user submits a form, the browser collects all named input values and sends them as key-value pairs to the server.

    "description": "HTML tables are designed for displaying tabular data — information that belongs in rows and columns, like spreadsheets, schedules, comparison charts, or statistics. A table is built with <table> as the container, <tr> for each row, <th> for header cells (bold and centered by default), and <td> for data cells. Modern tables use three semantic sections: <thead> (header row), <tbody> (main data), and <tfoot> (footer/totals). The 'colspan' attribute lets a cell span multiple columns, and 'rowspan' lets it span multiple rows. The <caption> element provides an accessible title for the table. An important rule: tables should ONLY be used for tabular data, never for page layout — that's CSS's job (Flexbox, Grid). Using tables for layout was common in the early 2000s but is now an anti-pattern that hurts accessibility and responsiveness. For accessibility, use 'scope' attributes on header cells (scope='col' or scope='row') to associate headers with data cells, helping screen readers navigate complex tables. While CSS handles visual styling (borders, alternating row colors, hover effects), HTML provides the semantic structure that gives meaning to the data.",

    "description": "Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. Instead of building everything with generic <div> elements, HTML5 introduced semantic elements that communicate the PURPOSE of the content. The <header> element marks the top section of a page or section (logos, navigation, titles). <nav> wraps navigation links. <main> contains the primary content (only one per page). <section> groups thematically related content. <article> marks self-contained content that could stand alone (blog posts, news articles, comments). <aside> marks tangential content (sidebars, related links, advertisements). <footer> marks the bottom section (copyright, contact info, additional links). <figure> and <figcaption> associate images with their captions. The <details> and <summary> elements create native collapsible sections without JavaScript — the browser handles the open/close interaction. <time> marks dates and times with machine-readable datetime attributes. Using semantic HTML has massive practical benefits: search engines understand your content better (improving SEO), screen readers can navigate by landmarks (improving accessibility), your code is more readable and maintainable, and browsers can apply better default styles. A page built with <div class='header'><div class='nav'> is functionally identical to <header><nav>, but the semantic version is objectively better in every measurable way.",

    "description": "Writing HTML that works is easy. Writing HTML that is accessible, SEO-friendly, performant, and maintainable is a professional skill that separates hobbyists from career developers. Accessibility (a11y) means ensuring your website can be used by everyone, including people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Over 1 billion people worldwide have some form of disability, and in many countries (US, EU, UK), web accessibility is a legal requirement under laws like the ADA and EAA. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes add semantic information to elements that lack it — aria-label for invisible labels, aria-hidden for decorative elements, role for custom components. Every image needs descriptive alt text (not 'image1.png'). Every form input needs a label. Interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable. Color alone should never be the only way to convey information. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) starts with HTML: proper <title> tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, structured data (JSON-LD), Open Graph tags for social sharing, and canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues. Performance best practices include minimizing DOM depth, using loading='lazy' on images, preloading critical fonts with <link rel='preload'>, and using async/defer on script tags to prevent render-blocking. Writing clean, validated HTML ensures cross-browser compatibility and future-proofs your code.",
    "whyItMatters": "Accessibility is not optional — it's a legal requirement (ADA lawsuits have increased 300% since 2018) and a moral imperative. SEO determines whether people can find your website. Performance directly impacts user retention (53% of users leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load). These skills are tested in frontend interviews at every major company.",
    "eli5": "Imagine you're building a playground. You wouldn't just build slides and swings — you'd also build ramps for wheelchairs, add Braille signs, and make sure the ground is safe. Web accessibility is the same idea: building websites that everyone can use, including people who can't see the screen (they use special software that reads the page out loud) or can't use a mouse (they use only the keyboard). Making your website accessible is like being a good architect who thinks about ALL the people who'll use the building!",
