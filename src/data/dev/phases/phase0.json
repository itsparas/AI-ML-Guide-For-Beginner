    "description": "Before writing a single line of code, it's essential to understand how the internet and world wide web actually work. When you type a URL like 'google.com' into your browser and press Enter, a fascinating chain of events unfolds in milliseconds. Your browser first contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server — think of it as the internet's phone book — to translate the human-readable domain name into a numerical IP address like 142.250.190.14. Your browser then sends an HTTP request to that server, asking for the webpage. The server processes this request and sends back an HTTP response containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Your browser then parses these files and renders the visual page you see. This is the client-server model: your browser is the 'client' that requests data, and the web server is the 'server' that responds with data. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the language they speak. HTTPS adds encryption via SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring your data (passwords, credit cards) can't be intercepted. Understanding this flow is foundational — every single concept you learn in web development (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript interactivity, APIs, hosting) connects back to this request-response cycle. Professional developers debug network issues, optimize load times, and architect systems based on these fundamentals daily.",
    "whyItMatters": "Every web technology you'll learn is built on top of this client-server architecture. Understanding how browsers fetch and render pages helps you debug issues, optimize performance, and make informed decisions about how to structure your code. Interviewers frequently ask about HTTP, DNS, and the request-response cycle.",
    "eli5": "Imagine you're ordering a pizza. You (the browser) call the pizza shop (the server) and ask for a pepperoni pizza (the web page). The pizza shop makes your pizza and delivers it to your door. The phone number you dial is like a URL, the phone company that connects your call is like DNS, and the pizza delivery is like the HTTP response bringing the website to your screen. HTTPS is like ordering through a secret code so no one can steal your pizza order!",

        "explanation": "The Internet is the global network of interconnected computers — the physical infrastructure of cables, routers, and servers that connects billions of devices worldwide. The World Wide Web (WWW) is just one service that runs ON TOP of the Internet, using HTTP/HTTPS to serve web pages. Other services also use the Internet: email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP), and video calls (WebRTC). Think of the Internet as the road system and the Web as just one type of vehicle driving on it. Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web in 1989 at CERN, but the Internet itself dates back to ARPANET in the 1960s."

        "name": "Client-Server Model",
        "explanation": "The client-server model is the fundamental architecture of the web. The 'client' is your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) — it sends requests for data. The 'server' is a remote computer that stores websites and responds with the requested files (HTML, CSS, JS, images). When you visit google.com, your browser (client) sends an HTTP request to Google's server, which processes it and sends back the webpage. This is a one-way initiation: the client always asks first, the server always responds. Think of it like a restaurant: you (client) place an order, and the kitchen (server) prepares and delivers your food."

        "explanation": "DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names like 'google.com' into machine-readable IP addresses like '142.250.190.14'. Computers communicate using IP addresses, but humans prefer memorable names. When you type a URL, your browser first checks its local DNS cache, then your operating system's cache, then your ISP's DNS server, and finally authoritative DNS servers to resolve the domain. The whole process typically takes 20-120 milliseconds. DNS is essentially the internet's phone book — you look up a name and get a number to call."

        "name": "HTTP Request & Response Cycle",
        "explanation": "Every interaction on the web follows a request-response cycle. When you click a link or type a URL: (1) Your browser creates an HTTP request with a method (GET, POST, etc.), headers (metadata), and optional body (data). (2) The request travels through the internet to the web server. (3) The server processes the request — it might read a file, query a database, or run application logic. (4) The server sends back an HTTP response containing a status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.), headers, and the response body (usually HTML). (5) Your browser receives the response and renders the page. This entire cycle typically takes 100ms-2 seconds."
      },
      {
        "name": "HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)",
        "explanation": "HTTP methods tell the server what action you want to perform. GET retrieves data (loading a webpage, fetching an API response) — it should never modify data. POST sends data to create something new (submitting a form, creating an account). PUT updates an existing resource completely (replacing a user's profile). PATCH partially updates a resource (changing just the email). DELETE removes a resource. These map to CRUD operations: Create=POST, Read=GET, Update=PUT/PATCH, Delete=DELETE. When you load a webpage, your browser sends a GET request. When you submit a login form, it sends a POST request."

      {
        "name": "HTTP Status Codes (200, 301, 404, 500)",
        "explanation": "Status codes are three-digit numbers the server sends back to indicate what happened. They fall into five categories: 1xx (Informational), 2xx (Success — 200 OK means everything worked, 201 Created means a new resource was made), 3xx (Redirects — 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Found/Temporary Redirect), 4xx (Client Errors — 400 Bad Request means you sent invalid data, 401 Unauthorized means you need to log in, 403 Forbidden means you don't have permission, 404 Not Found means the page doesn't exist), 5xx (Server Errors — 500 Internal Server Error means something broke on the server, 503 Service Unavailable means the server is down). Knowing these helps you debug issues quickly."
      },
      {
        "name": "HTTPS & SSL/TLS Encryption",
        "explanation": "HTTPS is HTTP with encryption added via SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security). When you visit an HTTPS site, your browser and the server perform a 'TLS handshake': they agree on an encryption method and exchange cryptographic keys. After that, all data flowing between you and the server is encrypted — even if someone intercepts it, they can't read it. This protects passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. The padlock icon in your browser's address bar indicates HTTPS is active. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) like Let's Encrypt (free) or DigiCert. Today, HTTPS is expected on ALL websites — Google even ranks HTTPS sites higher in search results."
      },
      {
        "name": "How Browsers Render Web Pages",
        "explanation": "When your browser receives HTML from a server, it goes through a multi-step rendering pipeline: (1) Parse HTML to build the DOM (Document Object Model) — a tree structure representing every element on the page. (2) Parse CSS to build the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) — all the style rules. (3) Combine DOM + CSSOM into the Render Tree — only visible elements with their computed styles. (4) Layout — calculate the exact position and size of every element on the page. (5) Paint — draw pixels to the screen (text, colors, images, borders). (6) Composite — combine layers for the final visual output. JavaScript can modify the DOM and CSSOM, triggering re-layouts and re-paints. Understanding this pipeline helps you write performant code that avoids unnecessary re-renders."

Hosting types include: Shared hosting (cheapest, your site shares a server with others), VPS (Virtual Private Server — a dedicated portion of a server), Cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure — scalable and pay-per-use), and Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages — free for simple sites). A domain name (like 'mysite.com') is a human-readable address you purchase from a registrar (like Namecheap or Google Domains). You connect your domain to your hosting by updating DNS records (A record pointing to your server's IP address). Together, hosting + domain = your website is live on the internet."

        "name": "Developer Tools: Network Tab",
        "explanation": "Every modern browser has built-in Developer Tools (press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I). The Network tab is essential for web development — it shows every HTTP request your page makes in real-time. For each request, you can see: the URL, HTTP method, status code, response time, file size, headers, and response body. This is invaluable for debugging: you can see if an API call failed (4xx/5xx status), if images are loading too slowly (large file sizes), or if requests are being blocked (CORS errors). You can also throttle your network speed to test how your site performs on slow connections. The Network tab is one of the most-used tools in a professional web developer's daily workflow."

    "description": "Every web page you've ever visited is built on HTML — HyperText Markup Language. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, like the skeleton of a building. An HTML document follows a strict structure: it starts with a DOCTYPE declaration that tells the browser 'this is an HTML5 document.' Then comes the <html> root element that wraps everything. Inside <html>, there are two main sections: <head> (metadata that's invisible to users — page title, character encoding, CSS links, meta descriptions for SEO) and <body> (everything visible on the page — text, images, buttons, forms). HTML uses 'tags' — keywords wrapped in angle brackets like <h1>, <p>, <div>. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag <p> and a closing tag </p>, with content in between. Some tags are self-closing like <img /> and <br />. Tags can have 'attributes' that provide additional information, like <a href='https://example.com'> where 'href' is an attribute specifying the link destination. Understanding this structure is absolutely fundamental — every framework (React, Vue, Angular) ultimately generates HTML. Even the most complex web applications are, at their core, HTML documents enhanced with CSS and JavaScript. Proper HTML structure also affects SEO, accessibility, and how search engines index your content.",

The <h1> block is a big heading, the <p> block is a paragraph of text, and the <img> block shows a picture. You stack these blocks inside each other to build your web page, just like stacking LEGO to build a house. The <head> is like the instruction manual that comes with the LEGO set — it's important but you don't see it in the finished building!",

HTML has none of that. It only describes STRUCTURE and CONTENT using tags. '<h1>' says 'this is a heading,' '<p>' says 'this is a paragraph.' HTML tells the browser WHAT to display, not HOW to process data. Think of it like a blueprint: it shows where the walls, doors, and windows go, but doesn't describe how to build them.

Without it, the browser enters 'quirks mode,' which emulates older rendering behavior from the IE5/Netscape era — your CSS will behave unpredictably and layouts may break. With the DOCTYPE, the browser uses 'standards mode,' following the HTML5 specification correctly. In older versions of HTML, the DOCTYPE was long and complex (like '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\">'). HTML5 simplified it to just '<!DOCTYPE html>'.

The 'lang' attribute (e.g., '<html lang=\"en\">') tells browsers and screen readers what language the content is in. This is critical for accessibility (screen readers use it to pronounce text correctly), SEO (search engines serve the right language version), and translation tools. Always set it! For multilingual pages, you can use 'lang' on individual elements too (e.g., '<p lang=\"fr\">Bonjour</p>')."

Without '<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">', special characters might appear as garbled text (mojibake). For example, 'café' might display as 'cafÃ©'.

Attributes always follow the name=\"value\" format. Some common global attributes work on any element: 'id' (unique identifier), 'class' (for CSS styling), 'style' (inline CSS), 'title' (tooltip text), 'data-*' (custom data attributes).

In HTML5, the trailing slash is optional ('<img />' and '<img>' are both valid), but many style guides recommend including it for clarity.

RIGHT: '<p><strong>text</strong></p>' (strong closes before p). Improper nesting causes bugs: broken layouts, accessibility issues, and unpredictable browser behavior.

This hierarchy isn't just visual — search engines and screen readers use it to understand your page structure. Paragraphs (<p>) are the workhorse of text content. The <strong> and <em> tags add semantic emphasis (not just bold/italic — they convey meaning to assistive technology). Lists come in three flavors: ordered (<ol>) for numbered sequences, unordered (<ul>) for bullet points, and description lists (<dl>) for term-definition pairs. The <blockquote> element marks quoted content, while <code> and <pre> handle code snippets. Line breaks (<br>) and horizontal rules (<hr>) provide structural breaks. Understanding when to use which element is critical for semantic HTML — it's not about how text looks (that's CSS's job), it's about what the text means. A common beginner mistake is using <br><br> for spacing instead of proper paragraph tags, or using headings just to make text big rather than to create meaningful document structure.",

The <br> (line break) element forces a new line within the same paragraph — use it sparingly, only where a line break is semantically meaningful (like in poems, song lyrics, or addresses). A common beginner mistake is using multiple <br><br> tags for spacing — always use CSS margin/padding instead.

Each item is wrapped in <li> (list item). Lists can be nested: put a <ul> inside an <li> to create sub-lists. The 'type' attribute on <ol> controls numbering style (1, A, a, I, i).

For multi-line code blocks, combine them: <pre><code>your code here</code></pre>.

CSS can style it extensively: change the color, width, style (dashed, dotted), or even make it invisible. Don't use <hr> for pure visual decoration — use CSS borders instead.

    "description": "The web's superpower is hyperlinks — the ability to connect any page to any other page with a simple click. The <a> (anchor) tag creates links using the 'href' attribute. Links can point to other websites (absolute URLs), other pages on your site (relative paths), sections within the same page (fragment identifiers using #), email addresses (mailto:), and phone numbers (tel:). The 'target' attribute controls where the link opens — '_blank' for a new tab, '_self' for the same tab. Images are the second most common content type, added via the self-closing <img> tag. The 'src' attribute specifies the image file, and the 'alt' attribute provides text description for accessibility (screen readers) and SEO. Modern HTML5 introduced native <video> and <audio> elements, replacing the need for Flash. The <video> tag supports multiple source formats for browser compatibility, along with controls, autoplay, muted, and loop attributes. The <picture> element enables responsive images — serving different image sizes based on screen width. The <iframe> element embeds external content like YouTube videos, Google Maps, or other web pages. Understanding image optimization (file formats, lazy loading, srcset for responsive images) is crucial for page performance — images often account for 50-70% of a page's total size.",
    "whyItMatters": "Links are literally what make the 'web' a web — they connect everything together. Images make content engaging and shareable. Proper alt text is legally required for accessibility compliance in many countries. Understanding media optimization directly impacts page load speed, which affects SEO rankings and user experience.",
    "eli5": "Links are like magic doors in a video game — click on one and you teleport to somewhere else! The <a> tag creates these doors. Images (<img>) are like stickers you paste onto your page. Videos (<video>) are like embedding a TV screen right in your page. And an iframe is like putting a window into your wall so you can see another room (another website) through it!",
    "subtopics": [

        "name": "Anchor Tag <a> and href Attribute",
        "explanation": "The <a> (anchor) tag is what makes the 'web' a web — it creates clickable links. The 'href' (hypertext reference) attribute specifies where the link goes. Example: '<a href=\"https://google.com\">Google</a>'. Without href, the <a> tag is just regular text. The link text between opening and closing tags should be descriptive — 'Learn more about CSS' is better than 'click here' for accessibility and SEO. You can also wrap images, divs, and other elements inside <a> tags to make them clickable. Links are inline elements by default, meaning they flow with surrounding text."

A relative URL is relative to the current page: 'about.html' (same folder), './images/logo.png' (subfolder), '../contact.html' (parent folder). Use absolute URLs for external links (other websites). Use relative URLs for internal links (pages on your own site) — they keep working even if your domain changes. Protocol-relative URLs like '//example.com' inherit the current page's HTTP/HTTPS protocol but are now discouraged — always use HTTPS."

        "name": "Opening Links in New Tab (target='_blank' rel='noopener')",
        "explanation": "By default, links open in the same tab. Adding target='_blank' opens the link in a new tab. However, this creates a security vulnerability: the new page can access your page via 'window.opener' and redirect it to a phishing site. Adding rel='noopener noreferrer' prevents this. 'noopener' blocks window.opener access, and 'noreferrer' hides the referrer header. Modern browsers add noopener automatically for target='_blank', but it's best practice to include it explicitly. Only use target='_blank' for external links — internal navigation should stay in the same tab for better UX."

        "name": "Linking to Page Sections with Fragment IDs (#)",
        "explanation": "Fragment links (also called anchor links or hash links) jump to a specific section on the same page. Give any element an 'id' attribute, then link to it with '#id': '<a href=\"#contact\">Go to Contact</a>' scrolls to '<section id=\"contact\">'. You can also link to sections on other pages: 'about.html#team'. The browser adds scroll behavior automatically. Adding 'scroll-behavior: smooth' in CSS makes it animate smoothly instead of jumping instantly. Fragment IDs are also used in single-page applications for routing and in documentation sites for deep-linking to specific headings."

You can pre-fill subject and body too: 'mailto:hello@example.com?subject=Hello&body=Hi there'. 'tel:' links trigger phone dialers on mobile devices: '<a href=\"tel:+1234567890\">Call Us</a>'. Always use the international format (+country code). These are essential for contact pages and mobile-friendly sites.

'alt' provides alternative text — it's shown if the image fails to load, read by screen readers, and used by search engines. Always write descriptive alt text: 'Golden retriever playing fetch in a park' not 'dog.jpg'. Setting explicit 'width' and 'height' attributes prevents layout shift (CLS) — the browser reserves space before the image loads, so the page doesn't jump around. This is a key performance metric that affects Google rankings."

SVG: vector format for icons, logos, and illustrations — scales to any size without pixelation, tiny file size, can be styled with CSS. WebP: Google's modern format, 25-35% smaller than JPEG at the same quality, supports transparency. AVIF: newest format, 50% smaller than JPEG, excellent quality. Use WebP/AVIF with JPEG/PNG fallbacks for maximum compatibility."

The browser picks the best size automatically — a phone gets the 400px image, a desktop gets the 1200px version. The <picture> element goes further, allowing different image FORMATS or completely different images for different screen sizes using <source> elements with media queries. This can reduce page size by 40-60% on mobile devices."

        "explanation": "By default, browsers load ALL images on a page immediately — even ones far below the visible area (below the fold). The 'loading=\"lazy\"' attribute tells the browser to defer loading off-screen images until the user scrolls near them. This dramatically improves initial page load speed and saves bandwidth. Usage: '<img src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"...\" loading=\"lazy\">'. Don't lazy-load images that are visible immediately (above the fold) — those should load instantly. Also applies to <iframe> elements. This single attribute can reduce initial page load by 30-50% on image-heavy pages."

Key attributes: 'controls' shows play/pause/volume/fullscreen buttons, 'autoplay' starts automatically (requires 'muted' on most browsers), 'loop' repeats endlessly, 'poster' shows a thumbnail before playback, 'preload' controls when video data is fetched. Multiple <source> elements provide format fallbacks: MP4 (most compatible), WebM (smaller, open format). Text between the tags shows if the browser doesn't support video. Always provide controls — autoplay without user consent is bad UX and blocked by most browsers."

Common formats: MP3 (universal support), OGG (open format), WAV (uncompressed, large files). Like video, use multiple <source> elements for format fallbacks. Audio is used for: music players, podcast embeds, notification sounds, and interactive web apps. The Web Audio API (JavaScript) provides advanced audio processing — visualizations, effects, spatial audio — but the basic <audio> element handles simple playback needs without any JavaScript."

Key attributes: 'src' (the URL to embed), 'width'/'height', 'title' (required for accessibility), 'allowfullscreen', 'loading=\"lazy\"'. Security: the 'sandbox' attribute restricts what the embedded page can do. Be cautious with iframes — they add HTTP requests and can slow your page. Never embed untrusted content without sandboxing."

    "description": "Forms are how users interact with websites — every login page, search bar, contact form, checkout flow, and survey is built with HTML forms. The <form> element wraps all form controls and defines where the data gets submitted (action attribute) and how (method: GET or POST). HTML5 introduced a powerful suite of input types beyond basic text: email (with built-in validation), password (masked dots), number (spin buttons), date (calendar picker), range (slider), color (color picker), file (upload), and more. Each input should have a <label> element linked via matching 'for' and 'id' attributes — this is critical for accessibility (screen readers announce the label when the input is focused). The <select> element creates dropdowns, <textarea> handles multi-line text, and <fieldset> with <legend> groups related inputs. HTML5 form validation attributes (required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, min, max) let you validate user input without any JavaScript — the browser handles error messages and prevents submission of invalid forms. Understanding form data flow is essential: when a user submits a form, the browser collects all named input values and sends them as key-value pairs to the server. This is the foundation of all user input handling in web development.",
    "whyItMatters": "Forms are the primary mechanism for user input on the web. Every authentication system, search feature, e-commerce checkout, and data entry interface uses forms. HTML5 validation reduces JavaScript code and improves user experience with native browser validation UI. Proper form accessibility is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions.",

The 'method' attribute determines HOW it's sent: GET appends data to the URL as query parameters (visible, bookmarkable, limited to ~2000 characters — use for search, filters). POST sends data in the request body (hidden, no size limit — use for passwords, file uploads, creating data). Without a method, forms default to GET. Without an action, the form submits to the current page URL. Forms can also use 'enctype' to specify encoding — 'multipart/form-data' is required for file uploads."

On mobile, it shows a numeric keypad. type='range' creates a slider control — visually intuitive for values like volume (0-100) or brightness.

These inputs use the 'min', 'max', and 'step' attributes. The value is always in ISO 8601 format ('2025-02-16' for date, '14:30' for time) regardless of how it's displayed. These eliminate the need for bulky third-party date picker libraries for simple use cases."

The 'multiple' attribute allows multi-selection. <datalist> creates an autocomplete suggestion list: '<input list=\"fruits\"><datalist id=\"fruits\"><option value=\"Apple\"></datalist>'. The user can type freely but sees suggestions. Each serves a different UX purpose: checkboxes for multi-select, radios for single-select, dropdowns for long lists."

The 'accept' attribute filters file types: accept='image/*' for images, accept='.pdf,.doc' for documents. The 'multiple' attribute allows multi-file selection. type='hidden' creates an invisible input that submits data without user interaction — used for CSRF tokens, user IDs, or tracking data. Hidden inputs are NOT secure (visible in page source/DevTools) — never use them for sensitive secrets. Each of these specialized inputs leverages native OS functionality."

Two ways to associate them: explicit (using 'for' and 'id': '<label for=\"email\">Email</label><input id=\"email\">') or implicit (wrapping the input: '<label>Email <input></label>'). Labels make the click target larger — clicking the label focuses/checks the input. Placeholders (placeholder='Enter email') are hints inside the input that disappear on focus — they are NOT replacements for labels. Screen readers may not announce placeholders. Many users mistake placeholder text for pre-filled values. Best practice: always use labels AND placeholders together."

Unlike <input>, textarea has a closing tag — default text goes between the tags, not in a 'value' attribute. Key attributes: 'rows' sets the visible height, 'cols' sets the width (but CSS is better for sizing). 'maxlength' limits characters, 'minlength' enforces a minimum. 'resize' CSS property controls whether users can drag to resize (set to 'none' to prevent). Content inside <textarea> preserves whitespace.

This is especially important for radio buttons and checkboxes: '<fieldset><legend>Gender</legend><label><input type=\"radio\" name=\"gender\" value=\"male\"> Male</label>...</fieldset>'. Screen readers announce the legend when these inputs are focused, providing context. Without fieldset/legend, screen readers just say 'radio button, Male' — with it, they say 'Gender, radio button, Male'. The 'disabled' attribute on <fieldset> disables ALL inputs inside it at once."

'min'/'max' enforce numeric/date ranges. 'pattern' uses regex for custom validation: pattern='[A-Za-z]{3,}' requires at least 3 letters. The browser shows built-in error messages and styles invalid inputs with the ':invalid' CSS pseudo-class. The ':valid' pseudo-class styles valid inputs. Use the 'title' attribute alongside 'pattern' to explain the expected format. Note: ALWAYS also validate on the server — client-side validation can be bypassed."

The <button> element is preferred because it can contain HTML (icons, styled text). type='reset' clears all form inputs to their default values — use sparingly, as users rarely want this and it can cause accidental data loss. type='button' does nothing by default — use it for JavaScript-driven actions that shouldn't trigger form submission. Default type for <button> inside a form is 'submit', so always specify type='button' if you don't want it to submit. You can also submit forms programmatically with form.submit() in JavaScript."

Inputs WITHOUT 'name' are ignored — a common bug when form data is missing. For GET requests, data becomes URL query parameters: '/search?q=javascript&sort=recent'. For POST requests, data is encoded in the request body. Checkboxes only send their value when checked. Disabled inputs are never included. The 'FormData' API in JavaScript lets you read, modify, and send form data programmatically — essential for AJAX form submissions. Understanding this flow is critical for debugging why data isn't reaching your server."

A table is built with <table> as the container, <tr> for each row, <th> for header cells (bold and centered by default), and <td> for data cells. Modern tables use three semantic sections: <thead> (header row), <tbody> (main data), and <tfoot> (footer/totals). The 'colspan' attribute lets a cell span multiple columns, and 'rowspan' lets it span multiple rows. The <caption> element provides an accessible title for the table. An important rule: tables should ONLY be used for tabular data, never for page layout — that's CSS's job (Flexbox, Grid). Using tables for layout was common in the early 2000s but is now an anti-pattern that hurts accessibility and responsiveness. For accessibility, use 'scope' attributes on header cells (scope='col' or scope='row') to associate headers with data cells, helping screen readers navigate complex tables. While CSS handles visual styling (borders, alternating row colors, hover effects), HTML provides the semantic structure that gives meaning to the data.",

Example: '<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th></tr><tr><td>Alice</td><td>25</td></tr></table>'. The number of <td>/<th> elements in each <tr> determines the number of columns. All rows should have the same number of cells for proper alignment."

These semantic sections enable: sticky table headers (CSS position: sticky on thead), separate styling for each section, better accessibility navigation, and proper printing (headers repeat on each printed page)."

These are commonly used for: table titles spanning the full width, category headers grouping related columns, or cells that logically belong to multiple rows. When using rowspan, remember that the spanned rows need fewer <td> elements.

Screen readers announce it when users encounter the table, giving context about what data the table contains. Example: '<table><caption>Student Grades — Spring 2025</caption>...'. Without a caption, screen readers just announce 'table with X rows and Y columns' with no context. CSS can position the caption above or below the table using 'caption-side: bottom'. A good caption describes the table's content concisely — it's essentially the table's heading."

For complex tables with multi-level headers, use 'headers' and 'id' attributes to explicitly link data cells to their headers. Without 'scope', screen readers try to guess the relationship — which often fails in complex tables, making the data incomprehensible to visually impaired users."

Alternating row colors (zebra stripes) with 'tr:nth-child(even) { background: #f9f9f9; }' improve readability. Hover effects with 'tr:hover { background: #e0e0e0; }' help users track rows. Padding on td/th adds breathing room. A consistent header style (different background color, bold text) distinguishes headers from data. For responsive tables on mobile, consider horizontal scrolling with 'overflow-x: auto' on a wrapper div."

Solutions include: wrapping the table in a div with 'overflow-x: auto' for horizontal scrolling (simplest), using CSS to transform rows into card-style blocks on mobile (each row becomes a vertical card with label-value pairs), hiding less-important columns with 'display: none' at certain breakpoints, or using the 'data-label' attribute on cells combined with CSS pseudo-elements to show column headers inline. Libraries like DataTables handle this automatically. Choose the approach based on data importance — critical data should always be visible without scrolling."

Layout tables break screen reader navigation, don't adapt to different screen sizes, mix content with presentation, and are harder to maintain. For page layout, use CSS Flexbox (one-dimensional layouts) or CSS Grid (two-dimensional layouts). A good test: if the data makes sense in a spreadsheet, use a table.

Instead of building everything with generic <div> elements, HTML5 introduced semantic elements that communicate the PURPOSE of the content. The <header> element marks the top section of a page or section (logos, navigation, titles). <nav> wraps navigation links. <main> contains the primary content (only one per page). <section> groups thematically related content. <article> marks self-contained content that could stand alone (blog posts, news articles, comments). <aside> marks tangential content (sidebars, related links, advertisements). <footer> marks the bottom section (copyright, contact info, additional links). <figure> and <figcaption> associate images with their captions. The <details> and <summary> elements create native collapsible sections without JavaScript — the browser handles the open/close interaction. <time> marks dates and times with machine-readable datetime attributes. Using semantic HTML has massive practical benefits: search engines understand your content better (improving SEO), screen readers can navigate by landmarks (improving accessibility), your code is more readable and maintainable, and browsers can apply better default styles. A page built with <div class='header'><div class='nav'> is functionally identical to <header><nav>, but the semantic version is objectively better in every measurable way.",

This is semantically richer than just putting an image with a <p> tag below it."

        "explanation": "<details> creates an interactive disclosure widget — a collapsible section that users can open and close by clicking. <summary> is the always-visible label/title. Everything else inside <details> is hidden until the user clicks <summary>. No JavaScript or CSS needed! The 'open' attribute makes it expanded by default. Multiple <details> elements create an accordion-style FAQ. You can style it with CSS: remove the default triangle marker, add animations, or change colors. Use cases: FAQs, troubleshooting steps, additional info that most users don't need, or chapter summaries. This is one of the most practical HTML5 elements — it replaces dozens of lines of JavaScript."

        "explanation": "The <time> element marks dates and times in content. The 'datetime' attribute provides the machine-readable format (ISO 8601), while the human-readable text goes between the tags. Example: '<time datetime=\"2025-02-16\">February 16, 2025</time>' or '<time datetime=\"14:30\">2:30 PM</time>'. This helps search engines understand dates (Google shows them in search results), enables date-based filtering, and allows browsers/extensions to add calendar events. Without <time>, 'February 16' is just text — with <time>, search engines know it's a date. Use it for publishing dates, event times, and any date reference."

        "name": "<mark> — Highlighted Text",
        "explanation": "<mark> highlights text to indicate relevance in the current context — like using a highlighter on a textbook. It renders with a yellow background by default. Common use cases: highlighting search terms in results (showing where the query matches), marking important passages in quoted text, or indicating changed/relevant content in a document. Unlike <strong> (important) or <em> (emphasized), <mark> means 'contextually relevant' — the text is highlighted because it's relevant NOW, not because it's inherently important. Screen readers announce marked text as 'highlighted', helping visually impaired users understand the emphasis."

        "name": "Semantic vs Non-Semantic: <div> and <span>",
        "explanation": "<div> and <span> are the two NON-semantic HTML elements — they have zero inherent meaning. <div> is a block-level generic container (starts on a new line, takes full width). <span> is an inline generic container (flows within text). Use them ONLY when no semantic element fits: for CSS styling hooks or JavaScript targets. Example: '<span class=\"price-highlight\">$19.99</span>' — there's no semantic element for 'price'. The goal is to use semantic elements first (<section>, <article>, <header>, etc.) and fall back to <div>/<span> only when nothing else makes sense. A page full of <div>s is called 'div soup' — hard to read, debug, and maintain."

    "description": "Writing HTML that works is easy. Writing HTML that is accessible, SEO-friendly, performant, and maintainable is a professional skill that separates hobbyists from career developers. Accessibility (a11y) means ensuring your website can be used by everyone, including people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Over 1 billion people worldwide have some form of disability, and in many countries (US, EU, UK), web accessibility is a legal requirement under laws like the ADA and EAA. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes add semantic information to elements that lack it — aria-label for invisible labels, aria-hidden for decorative elements, role for custom components. Every image needs descriptive alt text (not 'image1.png'). Every form input needs a label. Interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable. Color alone should never be the only way to convey information. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) starts with HTML: proper <title> tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy, structured data (JSON-LD), Open Graph tags for social sharing, and canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues. Performance best practices include minimizing DOM depth, using loading='lazy' on images, preloading critical fonts with <link rel='preload'>, and using async/defer on script tags to prevent render-blocking. Writing clean, validated HTML ensures cross-browser compatibility and future-proofs your code.",
    "whyItMatters": "Accessibility is not optional — it's a legal requirement (ADA lawsuits have increased 300% since 2018) and a moral imperative. SEO determines whether people can find your website. Performance directly impacts user retention (53% of users leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load). These skills are tested in frontend interviews at every major company.",
    "eli5": "Imagine you're building a playground. You wouldn't just build slides and swings — you'd also build ramps for wheelchairs, add Braille signs, and make sure the ground is safe. Web accessibility is the same idea: building websites that everyone can use, including people who can't see the screen (they use special software that reads the page out loud) or can't use a mouse (they use only the keyboard). Making your website accessible is like being a good architect who thinks about ALL the people who'll use the building!",
    "subtopics": [
      {
        "name": "Why Accessibility Matters (legal, ethical, business)",
        "explanation": "Web accessibility (a11y) ensures that websites can be used by everyone, including the 1+ billion people worldwide with disabilities — visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive. Legally, it's required: in the US, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) applies to websites, and lawsuits have increased 300% since 2018. The EU's European Accessibility Act (EAA) requires compliance by 2025. Ethically, the web was designed to be for everyone (Tim Berners-Lee). Business-wise, accessible sites reach more users, rank better in SEO, and have better overall UX — curb cuts benefit everyone, and so do accessibility features."

        "name": "ARIA Attributes: aria-label, aria-hidden, aria-describedby, role",
        "explanation": "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes add semantic information to elements that lack it. aria-label provides an invisible text label: '<button aria-label=\"Close\"><svg>...</svg></button>' — screen readers say 'Close button' instead of nothing. aria-hidden='true' hides decorative elements from screen readers (decorative icons, background images). aria-describedby links to an element that provides additional description. The 'role' attribute overrides an element's semantic role: role='alert' makes a div announce its content to screen readers. The golden rule: use native HTML elements first (<button>, <nav>). Only use ARIA when native semantics aren't sufficient."
      },
      {
        "name": "Alt Text Best Practices (descriptive, not 'image.png')",
        "explanation": "Alt text is the text alternative for images, read by screen readers and shown when images fail to load. Good alt text describes the IMAGE, not the file: 'Golden retriever catching a frisbee in a park' not 'dog.jpg' or 'image'. For informative images, describe what's shown. For functional images (links/buttons), describe the action: 'Search' for a magnifying glass icon. For decorative images, use empty alt: alt='' with role='presentation'. For complex images (charts, graphs), provide a detailed description or link to a data table. Alt text should be under 125 characters. Never start with 'Image of...' — screen readers already announce 'image'."
      },
      {
        "name": "Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management",
        "explanation": "All interactive elements must be usable with a keyboard alone — many users can't use a mouse. Native HTML elements (<button>, <a>, <input>) are keyboard-accessible by default: Tab moves focus, Enter/Space activates. Custom interactive elements built with <div> need tabindex='0' to be focusable and JavaScript keydown handlers. The focus order should follow the visual reading order. Visible focus indicators (the outline when an element is focused) must NEVER be removed with 'outline: none' — style them differently instead. Use ':focus-visible' CSS to show focus rings only for keyboard users, not mouse clicks. Skip links allow users to bypass navigation."
      },
      {
        "name": "Color Contrast Requirements (WCAG AA/AAA)",
        "explanation": "WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requires minimum color contrast ratios between text and background. Level AA (minimum standard): 4.5:1 for regular text, 3:1 for large text (18px+ bold or 24px+). Level AAA (enhanced): 7:1 for regular text, 4.5:1 for large text. Use contrast checker tools (WebAIM, Chrome DevTools) to verify ratios. Color should NEVER be the only way to convey information — adding icons, patterns, or text alongside color indicators ensures colorblind users (8% of men) can understand the content. Example: don't mark errors with only red text — add an error icon and descriptive message too."
      },
      {
        "name": "SEO Basics: <title>, Meta Description, Heading Hierarchy",
        "explanation": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) starts with HTML structure. <title> appears in browser tabs and search results — keep it under 60 characters, put the most important keyword first. Meta description (<meta name='description' content='...'>) appears below the title in search results — keep it under 155 characters, make it compelling. Heading hierarchy: one <h1> per page (the main topic), followed by <h2> for sections, <h3> for subsections. Never skip heading levels (h1 → h3). This creates an outline that search engines and screen readers use to understand content structure and importance."

        "name": "Open Graph Tags for Social Media Sharing",
        "explanation": "Open Graph (OG) tags control how your link appears when shared on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack, and other platforms. Without them, platforms guess (poorly) which title, description, and image to show. Key tags: og:title (the title shown), og:description (the snippet), og:image (the preview image — should be at least 1200×630px), og:url (the canonical URL), og:type (website, article, product). Place them in <head> as <meta property='og:title' content='...'/>. Twitter uses its own twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:image tags. Test using Facebook's Sharing Debugger or Twitter's Card Validator."

      {
        "name": "Structured Data with JSON-LD",
        "explanation": "Structured data (Schema.org markup) tells search engines EXACTLY what your content represents — not just text, but specific types like 'Recipe', 'Product', 'Event', 'Article', or 'FAQ'. JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is the recommended format: '<script type=\"application/ld+json\">{\"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"Article\", \"headline\": \"...\"}</script>'. This enables rich search results: star ratings on products, recipe cards with cooking times, event dates, FAQ accordions directly in Google. Google's Rich Results Test validates your structured data."
      },
      {
        "name": "Performance: async, defer, preload, lazy loading",
        "explanation": "How you load resources affects page speed dramatically. Scripts: 'defer' loads the script in parallel but executes AFTER HTML parsing (use for most scripts). 'async' loads and executes as soon as ready (use for independent scripts like analytics). Without either, scripts BLOCK HTML parsing (the page freezes until the script downloads and runs). Preload with '<link rel=\"preload\" href=\"font.woff2\" as=\"font\">' fetches critical resources early. 'loading=\"lazy\"' on images/iframes delays loading until they're near the viewport. These techniques can reduce page load time by 50-80% — crucial since 53% of users leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds."

        "name": "HTML Validation (W3C Validator)",
        "explanation": "The W3C HTML Validator (validator.w3.org) checks your HTML against the official specification and reports errors: missing closing tags, invalid attributes, deprecated elements, improper nesting, and more. Valid HTML ensures: consistent rendering across browsers, better accessibility (screen readers rely on proper markup), and fewer unexpected bugs. Run your pages through the validator during development. Common errors: unclosed tags, duplicate IDs (IDs must be unique), block elements inside inline elements (a <div> inside a <span>), missing 'alt' on images. Some errors are harmless but indicate sloppy code; others cause real rendering problems."

        "name": "Cross-Browser Compatibility",
        "explanation": "Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) can render the same HTML differently. Ensuring cross-browser compatibility means testing your site across major browsers and platforms. Use caniuse.com to check feature support before using newer HTML/CSS features. Common issues: Safari on iOS has unique bugs, Firefox may handle forms differently, older browsers don't support newer elements. Strategies: use HTML5 doctype, include proper meta charset and viewport tags, provide fallbacks for newer features, and use CSS resets or normalize.css to create a consistent baseline. Test on both desktop and mobile browsers."

        "explanation": "The favicon is the small icon shown in browser tabs, bookmarks, and history. Minimum requirement: a 32×32 .ico file linked with '<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\">'. For modern browsers, use SVG favicons: '<link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/favicon.svg\">'. For iOS devices, provide an apple-touch-icon (180×180 PNG): '<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/apple-icon-180.png\">'. For Android, a web manifest file (manifest.json) defines icons for the home screen. A professional website always has a custom favicon — the default generic icon looks unprofessional and makes it hard to find your tab among many open tabs."
